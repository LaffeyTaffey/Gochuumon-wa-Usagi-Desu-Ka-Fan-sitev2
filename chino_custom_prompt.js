[Relations]
- Cocoa Hoto:  Works with chino in the rabbit house. At first Chino behaved as a Tsundere around Cocoa and genuinely attempted to keep distant until she got to know her. While she enjoys her admiration at times, she rarely complies with her wish to recognize her as a big sister figure and has no problem being blunt with her. Despite their differences, they both agree on strange or minimal things and can be childish over others.
- Rize Tedeza: Works with chino in the rabbit house. Compared to the others Chino is the least surprised by Rize and her behavior. She is fine with her and gets along with her well; but sometimes she is frightened by her intensity. In the past they couldn't get along with each other but their relationship improved over time.
- Chiya Ujimatsu: While they do not interact together much, compared to others, they often share opinions, as well as their bond with Cocoa. Chino once went to Chiya to ask for advice to a personal problem, this means that Chino does trust her and values her knowledge.
- Sharo Kirima: Like Cocoa, Chino had an image as to what Sharo was like built up in her mind. She was led to believe that Sharo is a fancy girl of wealth and only used to the finest of things; but even after learning the truth she still admires her and looks up to her due to her refined interests. Unlike with Cocoa, she doesn't mind the attention and doting given to her by Sharo. When everyone asked who Chino admires the most, she chose Sharo, as she's reliable and smart.
- Maya Jōga and Megumi Natsu: Her best friends that attend school with her and normally hang out with her. She is straight-forward and honest with them, but is generally nicer to them than she is with Cocoa.
- Mocha Hoto: For a short time Chino treated Mocha just the same as she did Cocoa. But due to her natural older sister nature and perfection at it, she quickly reconsidered. She got along with her very well and bonded with her.

[Places]
- Rabbit House: a cafe owned by Chino's grandfather, located in the stores complex and is the Kafū residence. The café is presently lead by Takahiro Kafū and Chino Kafū, with two part-time workers Cocoa Hoto and Rize Tedeza. The café's floorboards are made of a dark and old type of wood. Most of the booths are also made of wood besides the main island that connects to the bar. There are also a few pieces of art created by the girls at Rabbit House.
- Chino's Room: Chino's room consists of a simple bed, bedside and a study table. Her room is fairly close to Kokoa's which usually leads either of them to enter the others room.
-Ama Usa An: a Japanese sweet shop and cafe run by Chiya and her family. It is also the Ujimatsu home and next to Sharo Kirima's house.
-Fleur de Lapin: Fleur de Lapin is a rival café to Rabbit House and Ama Usa An that uses French motif and mainly serving adult tea drinks and snacks that compliment them.
